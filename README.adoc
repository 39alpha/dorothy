[[introduction]]
== Introduction

*Dorothy* is a unified solution for data management, versioning, hosting, and
distribution, and aims to be accessible to researchers in any field, working
from anywhere, managing any kind of data, from initial data curation through to
publication and long-term archiving.

While *Dorothy* is still a work in progress, we have four ambitious objectives:

1. *Make data more transparent.* Researchers will be able to easily track
   versions of their data over time, linking specific versions to particular
   analyses.
2. *Increase data accessibility.* Anyone with an internet connection will be
   able to quickly download and contribute data products, either via centralized
   repositories or from the peer-to-peer network, opening collaboration and
   access possibilities otherwise impossible.
3. *Improve reproducibility.* Datasets are referenceable by their content,
   not their names. Subsequent efforts built on such data can be certain
   that the data assets are identical to those used previously, improving
   reproducibility.
4. *Further inclusive practices.* Dorothy will provide both the tools and
   venue for diverse and inclusive communities of researchers around the world,
   analogous to GitHub for software developers. Dorothy will also provide data
   storage and dissemination resources to those without the means to run their
   own Dorothy node.

Ideally, updating a dataset should be as simple as:
[source,shell]
----
# Clone an existing dataset to your machine
$ dorothy clone https://dorothy.39alpharesearch.org/team/dataset
$ cd dataset

# View the history
$ dorothy log

# Checkout a version
$ dorothy checkout Qm123 data

# Edit the data

# Commit a new version
$ dorothy commit data

# Push the changes back to the remote host
$ dorothy push
----

*Dorothy* comes with a "dataforge" analgous to Gitlab/Github, but specifically
for managing datasets.
[source,shell]
----
$ dorothy serve
----
Anyone can host a *Dorothy* dataforge if they choose, or use a

Foundations and Inspiration::

* link:https://git-scm.com/[git] - Dorothy's interface is designed to mirror
  `git`
* link:https://darcs.net/[darcs] - The way Dorothy manages history mirrors
  `darcs` in many ways
* link:https://ipfs.tech[IPFS] - Dorothy uses IPFS for content-based hashing,
  deduplication and peer-to-peer networking.
